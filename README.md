# ICT_Data_Exploration

This project explores key Information and Communication Technology (ICT) indicators for selected countries.

It contains one Jupyter notebook with code and visualizations. All generated charts are also saved in the [figures](figures) folder for easy access.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to provide an exploratory analysis of ICT indicators in a concise and visual format. The project emphasizes easy-to-understand charts, allowing anyone to grasp key insights without needing programming knowledge.

## Focus Countries:

-Germany

-Saudi Arabia

-South Africa

-Armenia

-Afghanistan

-Ukraine

## Key Indicators Analyzed

Internet Usage - Percentage of individuals using the Internet.

Households with Internet Access - Percentage of households with access to the Internet at home.

Mobile and Mobile-Broadband Subscriptions - Number of subscriptions over time.

ICT Skills: Communication & Collaboration - Proportion of individuals with basic ICT skills.

Household Expenditure on ICT - Share of total household expenditure spent on ICT goods and services.

Global Cybersecurity Index - Overall cybersecurity readiness score by country.

Relationship between Internet Usage and Cybersecurity Readiness - Scatter plot comparing these two dimensions.

## How to Explore

All visualizations are ready to view directly in the notebook.

Simply open ICT_Data_Exploration.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or VS Code, and you’ll see the charts and insights without needing to run any code.

This allows anyone, regardless of programming knowledge, to quickly understand the project and its key findings.

## Data

All data used in this project is stored in the data/ folder. The main CSV files include:

-ict_skills.csv - Data on individuals’ ICT skills

-households_internet.csv - Household internet access

-mobile_subscriptions.csv - Mobile subscriptions

-mobile_broadband.csv - Mobile broadband subscriptions

-internet_users.csv - Internet usage by individuals

-ict_expenditure.csv - Household expenditure on ICT

-cybersecurity_index.csv - Global Cybersecurity Index

Data sources are official statistics from national and international organizations.

## Visualizations

-The notebook provides line charts, bar charts, and scatter plots to make trends and comparisons intuitive and visually clear:

-Trends in Internet usage and household access over time

-Growth of mobile and mobile-broadband subscriptions

-Country comparison of ICT skills

-Household expenditure trends

-Cybersecurity readiness and its relation to Internet usage
